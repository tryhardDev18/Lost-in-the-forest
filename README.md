Lost in the forest is a choice-driven HTML/CSS/JavaScript story game where you wake up alone in a mysterious forest with no memory of who you are. Every scene gives you four choices that slowly uncover clues about your past while leading you deeper into the woods.

As you explore abandoned paths, hidden cabins, and strange noises in the trees, something begins following you… something that feels strangely familiar.

The goal is simple: escape the forest.
But the truth waiting outside might be darker—and more real—than anything inside.
